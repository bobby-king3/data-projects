A soccer analytics dashboard analyzing the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final between Argentina and France using StatsBomb event data.


## Project Overview

This project creates a complete match analysis dashboard featuring:
- **Pass Networks** - Player connections and average positions
- **Shot Maps** - Shot locations with Expected Goals (xG) values  
- **xG Flow Chart** - Cumulative Expected Goals throughout the match

**Final Result**: Argentina 3-3 France (4-2 on penalties)


## Key Statistics Used
